## Overview
- Use pure [dart-lang](https://dart.dev)
- SIP over WebSocket (use real SIP in your [flutter/web](https://flutter.dev) apps)
- Audio/video calls ([flutter-webrtc](https://github.com/cloudwebrtc/flutter-webrtc)) and instant messaging
- Support with standard SIP servers such as OpenSips, Kamailio, Asterisk, FreeSwitch.

## NOTE
Thanks to the original authors of [JsSIP](https://github.com/versatica/JsSIP) for providing the JS version, which makes it possible to port the [dart-lang](https://dart.dev).
